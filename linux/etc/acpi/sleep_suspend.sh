# This script HANDLES the sleep or suspend button (does not TRANSLATE it). It
# is part of the *suspend* side of acpi-support, not the special keys
# translation side. If this script is called, it is assumed to be the result of
# a suspend key press that can also be heard by other parts of the system. The
# only time that it actually does something is when it is determined that no
# other parts of the system are listening (this is what the CheckPolicy call
# does).
