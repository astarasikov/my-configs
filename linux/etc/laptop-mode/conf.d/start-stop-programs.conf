# Start/Stop Programs settings
# ----------------------------
#
# Laptop mode tools can automatically start and stop programs when entering
# various power modes. Put scripts accepting "start" and "stop" parameters
# in the directories
#    /etc/laptop-mode/batt-stop
#    /etc/laptop-mode/batt-start
#    /etc/laptop-mode/lm-ac-stop
#    /etc/laptop-mode/lm-ac-start
#    /etc/laptop-mode/nolm-ac-stop
#    /etc/laptop-mode/nolm-ac-start
# Laptop mode will call the scripts in a state-"stop" directory with the "stop"
# parameter when entering the state in question, and it will call the same
# scripts with the "start" parameter when leaving the state. Scripts in a
# state-"start" directory are called with the "start" parameter when the
# specified state is entered, and with the "stop" parameter when the specified
# state is left.
#
# Alternatively, if you only want to start/stop services, you can place the
# names of these services in one of the ..._STOP and ..._START config values
# below.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: In versions 1.36 and earlier, these settings were included in the
# main laptop-mode.conf configuration file. If they are still present, they
# overrule the settings in this file. To fix this, simply delete the settings
# from the main config file.
