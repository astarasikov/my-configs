# HAL polling settings
# --------------------
#
# If you enable this module, laptop mode tools will control the polling of
# your CD/DVD drives by HAL. Disabling polling saves a considerable amount of
# power, but for some older CD/DVD drives it means that inserted CDs are no
# longer autodetected. In such cases, you must turn this option off.
# Alternatively, you can configure laptop mode tools to turn HAL polling on only
# when the laptop is running on AC power. This would mean that CDs are not
# autodetected while the laptop is running on battery power, but the power
# savings may be worth the extra manual labour when you insert a CD.
