Further, Licensee may not, nor permit anyone else to (i) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or analyze the physical construction of the Software, or any component thereof, for any purpose, (ii) alter, modify, translate, network, rent, lease, loan, distribute, or create derivative works based upon the Software in whole or in part, (iii) copy any Software, (iv) disclose the Software to any third party, or (v) use the Software except as specifically contemplated in this License.

THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED TO LICENSEE ''AS IS'' AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, KCI AND KCI'S LICENSOR(S) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ASSOCIATED MATERIALS PROVIDED.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR REMEDIES HEREUNDER ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. FURTHER, THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF KCI AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF LICENSEE, FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION.

All disputes arising in connection therewith shall be heard only by a court of competent jurisdiction in San Diego County, California, and the prevailing party in any legal proceeding shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License shall continue in full force and effect.

Export; Re-export. This Software and/or technology is controlled by the U.S. Government.

Miscellaneous Provisions. No addition to or modification to this License shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the respective representatives of KCI and Licensee. Any delay or failure to enforce at any time any provision of this License shall not constitute a waiver of the right thereafter to enforce each and every provision thereof. If any of the provisions of this License are determined to be invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The rights and remedies expressly provided herein are not exclusive, but are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. The rights and obligations which by their sense and context are intended to survive any termination or expiration of the License shall so survive.
