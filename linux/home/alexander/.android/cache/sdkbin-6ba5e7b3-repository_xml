END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Software Agreement ("Agreement") is between You (either an individual or an entity), the End User, and Sony Mobile Communications AB ("Sony"). The Agreement authorizes You to use the Software specified in Clause 1 below, which may be stored on a CD-ROM, sent to You by electronic mail, or downloaded from Sony’s Web pages or Servers or from other sources under the terms and conditions set forth below. This is an agreement on end-user rights and not an agreement for sale. Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Sony and/or its licensors continues to own the copy of the Software and the physical media contained in the sales package and any other copy that You are authorized to make pursuant to this Agreement.
Read this Agreement carefully before installing, downloading, or using the Software. By clicking on the "I Accept" button while installing, downloading, and/or using the Software, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, promptly click the "Decline" or "I Do Not Accept" button, cancel the installation or downloading, or destroy or return the Software and accompanying documentation to Sony. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. SOFTWARE.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Software" means, collectively: (i) the software product identified above (ii) all the contents of the disk(s), CD-ROM(s), electronic mail and its file attachments, or other media with which this Agreement is provided, including the object code form of the software delivered via a CD-ROM, electronic mail, or Web page (iii) digital images, stock photographs, clip art, or other artistic works ("Stock Files") (iv) related explanatory written materials and any other possible documentation related thereto ("Documentation"); (v) fonts, and (vi) upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software (collectively "Updates"), if any, licensed to You by Sony under this Agreement.

2. END USER RIGHTS AND USE.

Sony grants You non-exclusive, non-transferable end-user rights to install the Software on the local hard disk(s) or other permanent storage media of one computer and use the Software on a single computer or terminal at a time. Except as provided by any Open Source License Terms, You may use the Software only for the sole purpose of testing and developing Your own applications and/or content.
You acknowledge that certain software components of the EDK (“Open Source Components”) may be covered by so-called “Open Source License Terms”. As used herein, Open Source License Terms means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of use, modification, or distribution of the software licensed under such license or other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software, requires that the distributor: (a) make the software available in source code format; (b) grant permission for creation of derivative works; or (c) grant a royalty free license thereto or under any associated intellectual property rights. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components require Sony to provide source code for such Open Source Component to You, Sony shall do so upon Your request. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components require Sony to make an offer to provide source code for such Open Source Component to You, this provision constitutes such offer. You shall not otherwise cause any portion of the EDK to become subject to any license obligation under any Open Source License Terms. For clarity, in the event that all or any portion of the Software provided hereunder does not reference, or otherwise indicate, such Open Source License Terms, this Agreement shall control. Please review the complete list of Open Source Components and Open Source License Terms found in the NOTICE.txt file accompanying the Software when applicable.

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.

Unless a Third Party License provides otherwise as to a particular portion of the Software, You may not copy, distribute, or make derivative works of the Software except as follows:
(a) You may make one copy of the Software on magnetic media as an archival backup copy, provided Your archival backup copy is not installed or used on any computer. Any other copies You make of the Software are in violation of this Agreement.
(b) You may not use, modify, translate, reproduce, or transfer the right to use the Software or copy the Software except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
(c) You may not resell, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the Software.
(d) You may not reverse engineer, reverse compile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software (except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by law) or create derivative works based on the Software.
(e) Unless stated otherwise in the Documentation, You shall not display, modify, reproduce, or distribute any of the Stock Files included with the Software. In the event that the Documentation allows You to display the Stock Files, You shall not distribute the Stock Files on a stand-alone basis, i.e., in circumstances in which the Stock Files constitute the primary value of the product being distributed. You should review the "Readme" files associated with the Stock Files that You use to ascertain what rights You have with respect to such materials. Stock Files may not be used in the production of libelous, defamatory, fraudulent, infringing, lewd, obscene, or pornographic material or in any otherwise illegal manner. You may not register or claim any rights in the Stock Files or derivative works thereof.
(f) You agree that You shall only use the Software in a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which You use the Software, including, but not limited to, applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights.
Where a Third Party License provides additional rights to copy, distribute, or make derivative works of a particular portion of the Software, those additional rights apply only to such portion, and to no other.

4. COPYRIGHT.

The Software and all rights, without limitation including proprietary rights therein, are owned by Sony and/or its licensors and affiliates and are protected by international treaty provisions and all other applicable national laws of the country in which it is being used. The structure, organization, and code of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Sony and/or its licensors and affiliates. You must not copy the Software, except as set forth in clause 3 (Limitations On End-User Rights). Any copies which You are permitted to make pursuant to this Agreement must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the Software.

5. MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENT SOFTWARE / MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SOFTWARE / DUAL MEDIA SOFTWARE / MULTIPLE COPIES / UPDATES.

If the Software supports multiple platforms or languages, if You receive the Software on multiple media, or if You otherwise receive multiple copies of the Software, the number of computers on which all versions of the Software are installed shall be one computer. You may not rent, lease, sublicense, lend, or transfer versions or copies of the Software You do not use. If the Software is an Update to a previous version of the Software, You must possess valid end-user rights to such a previous version in order to use the Update, and You may use the previous version for ninety (90) days after You receive the Update in order to assist You in the transition to the Update. After such time You no longer have a right to use the previous version, except for the sole purpose of enabling You to install the Update. The foregoing limitations in this clause 5 may not apply to portions of the Software covered by Open Source License Terms. Please see the file NOTICE.txt accompanying the Software for details.

6. COMMENCEMENT &amp; TERMINATION.

Notwithstanding the above, this Agreement will terminate, and the license granted to you by this Agreement will be revoked, immediately, without any notice from Sony, if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy the Software. In such an event, You must immediately delete, destroy, or return at Your own cost, the Software, all backup copies, and all related material to Sony.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW NEITHER SONY, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES, NOR THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, OR OTHER RIGHTS. THERE IS NO WARRANTY BY SONY OR BY ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS AND FOR THE INSTALLATION, USE, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM IT.

8. NO OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

This Agreement creates no obligations on the part of Sony other than as specifically set forth herein.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SONY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, SALES, DATA, OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, ECONOMIC, COVER, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER ARISING UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SONY OR ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES ARE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME COUNTRIES/STATES/ JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, IN SUCH CASES, SONY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Sony's liability to You in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Sony's negligence. Sony is acting on behalf of its employees and licensors or affiliates for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding, and/or restricting obligations, warranties, and liability as provided in this clause 9, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

10. TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

Sony has no obligation to furnish You with technical support unless separately agreed in writing between You and Sony.

11. EXPORT CONTROL.

The Software, including technical data, includes cryptographic software subject to export controls under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and may be subject to import or export controls in other countries. Software may not be downloaded, or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into, or to a national or resident of, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Syria, or any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nations or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders. The EAR prohibits the use of the Software and technical data by a Government End User, as defined hereafter, without a license from the U.S. government. A Government End User is defined in Part 772 of the EAR as "any foreign central, regional, or local government department, agency, or other entity performing governmental functions; including governmental research institutions, governmental corporations, or their separate business units (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) which are engaged in the manufacture or distribution of items or services controlled on the Wassenaar Munitions List, and international governmental organizations.
